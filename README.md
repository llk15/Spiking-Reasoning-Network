# Spiking-Reasoning-Network
This repository is about the model called **Spiking Reasoning Network** introduced in the paper [A Vertical-Horizontal Integrated Neuro-Symbolic Framework towards Artificial General Intelligence](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VstRq5DVB8HkKPup1Rd61nEzzpnNQ9Uv/view) of [AGI-23](https://agi-conf.org/2023/2023-accepted-papers/) conference.

The model is tested on [CLEVR](https://cs.stanford.edu/people/jcjohns/clevr/) and [CLEVRER](http://clevrer.csail.mit.edu/) datasets.

Part of the codes of CLEVR dataset has been uploaded. The rest of the codes will be uploaded after revision.
